My primary contribution is in developing commercial quality Speech Recognition system for Samsung S-Voice, Voice Assistant. We have successfully developed and deployed Speech Recognition for two major english locale and currently working on another region specific english locale. I have worked on all the modules of Speech Recognition solution and helped to setup a pipeline for developing and improving speech recognition solution for different locales. I have also worked on developing high quality speech synthesis system by combining unit selection based technologies and statistical parametric synthesis techniques.
